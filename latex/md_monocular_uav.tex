This package is designed to work hand in hand with Y\+O\+LO and Ardupilot to give the U\+AV awareness of where detected objects are in the U\+AV\textquotesingle{}s navigational frame. This package uses the intrinsics of the camera (the field of view) as well as the mounting angle and the Drone\textquotesingle{}s position.

\subsection*{Why use this package?}

In order to get the position of a detection the traditional solution is to use a stereo camera. However, stereo cameras have 2 significant drawbacks.

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries{1.) They are much hevier than monocular cameras}}

{\bfseries{2.) Stereo algorithms require more computational processing}} \end{quote}


By using this package your U\+AV will have more available computational power and be physically much lighter (This can create significant flight time increases)

\subsection*{What are the limitations of this package?}

This package make 2 key assumptions \begin{quote}
{\bfseries{1.) Detected objects reside on the ground}}

{\bfseries{2.) Detected object\textquotesingle{}s height are much less than the altitude of the drone}} \end{quote}


\subsection*{Original Use Case}

This package was orginally used to detect roombas for I\+A\+RC\textquotesingle{}s mission 7. The position of all the roombas fed back to a state machine running onboard the drone which then made decisions on which roombas to pursue.
