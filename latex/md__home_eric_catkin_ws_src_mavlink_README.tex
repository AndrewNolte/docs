M\+A\+V\+Link -- Micro Air Vehicle Message Marshalling Library.

M\+A\+V\+Link is a very lightweight, header-\/only message library for communication between drones and/or ground control stations. It consists primarily of message-\/set specifications for different systems (\char`\"{}dialects\char`\"{}) defined in X\+ML files, and Python tools that convert these into appropriate source code for \href{https://mavlink.io/en/\#supported_languages}{\texttt{ supported languages}}. There are additional Python scripts providing examples and utilities for working with M\+A\+V\+Link data.

{\bfseries{Tip}} M\+A\+V\+Link is very well suited for applications with very limited communication bandwidth. Its reference implementation in C is highly optimized for resource-\/constrained systems with limited R\+AM and flash memory. It is field-\/proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers. \end{quote}
